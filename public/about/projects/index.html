<h3 id="bitspark-narrowing-the-gap-between-human-thinking-and-computer-language">bitspark - Narrowing the gap between human thinking and computer language.</h3>

<p>Programming today requires a shift in thinking. This makes it hard to learn how to write programs. On top of that, IT experts often use a language which is difficult to understand for non technicians.<br />
At <a href="https://bitspark.de">bitspark.de</a> we develop <a href="https://github.com/Bitspark/slang">Slang</a> which aims to make programming easier, faster and more comfortable. It avoids coding, repetition and frustration. <a href="https://bitspark.de/slang/">Read more</a></p>

<h3 id="telstar-producers-and-consumers-for-redis-streams">telstar - producers and consumers for redis streams</h3>

<p>This library is what came out of creating a distributed service architecture for one of our products. Telstar makes it easy to write consumer groups and producers against redis streams.
In order to run our distributed architecture at <a href="https://bitspark.de">@bitspark</a> we needed a way to receive and produces messages with an exactly once delivery design. We think that, by packing up our assumptions into a separate library we can make it easy for other services to adhere to our initial design and/or comply to future changes. - <a href="https://github.com/Bitspark/telstar/">Read more</a></p>

<h3 id="lace-dotfile-management">lace - dotfile management</h3>

<p>Logging in to different machines at work or at home and using the same .dotfiles on them. Bootstrap a new machine, even if they are differently flavored. Updating .dotfiles should be a breeze as well as sharing common .dotfiles with your teammates by just installing them next to your own .dotfiles. Lace drew inspiration from brew. - <a href="https://github.com/kairichard/lace">Read more</a></p>

<h3 id="beautyfiles-net">beautyfiles.net</h3>

<p>As a freelancer I built a web based image archive software for a client. Using several state of the art tools to fulfil the functional specifications which where presented to me. A cascading category based navigation, a lightbox based cart, a live translation tool and a drag and drop image uploader. Moreover there is a full blown admin interface to manage all aspects of the application.</p>

<h3 id="ibusiness-de">ibusiness.de</h3>

<p>Over the course of 10 months we rewrote a large portion of the web application at ibusiness.de so it would resemble a modern MVC app more closely. Together we redid the Database-Abstraction-Layer, reimplemented all the affected controllers and wrote a new template parser. Being done with that we designed an applied a more effective way of organizing files inside the project.</p>

<h3 id="freundenews">freundenews</h3>

<p>Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed">friendfeed</a> we took the concept and adapted it to the German market and eventually <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/04/copy-paste-get-acquired-mister-wong-buys-freundenews/">sold to Mr.Wong</a>.</p>
