We are going down memory lane and try to understand why VI(M) exists and what sets it apart from other editors. With the history straightened up, we learn how to quit VIM and some other advanced tricks as well as the mental modal behind editing files with VIM. Last but not least we are going to look at how to configure VIM and where it makes sense to use and where it doesn't.
