At M2. I am responsible for two business units Managed Services and M2 Solutions. Managed Service includes running and maintaining the clientâ€™s AWS environments with Terraform according to the agreed SLAs and closely monitoring profitablility. Solutions include the development and selling of a webserver-based Tableau Extension. I also introduced a goal framework for the company in order to surface, structure, and align all business units to agreed-upon goals. Apart from that I prepare and lead internal management workshops as well as client projects and sales pitches. In order to build a better-performing company, I have created a structured resource planning process as well as setting up reflection session to help my current team and colleagues.

**Tools:** Tableau, AWS, Terraform, Bitbucket, Jira, Confluence, Miro, PHP, Java, Docker
