Led, designed and developed several critical software components for instance the symmetric cryptographic activation mechanism for PRTG, a product with 200k customers. Added goldilocks pricing strategy which alone led to ~3% more revenue.

I also developed tools to find abandoned shopping carts that resulted in recovering seemingly lost sales opportunities boosting conversion on followups. Maintained and optimized our infrastructure for these projects using Ansible, statsd and PRTG to deliver more throughput and consume less resources. Successfully introduced Scrum and carefully refined it to fit our needs through many iterations and retrospectives. Furthermore did I migrate a large repository from SVN to Git and Gitlab w/o service interruption, setting the groundwork for the rest of the company to eventually switch from Mercurial to GIT and reap in [huge benefits from easier Continuous Integration](https://about.gitlab.com/customers/paessler/).

**Tools:** Python, Javascript, Django, Flask, Gitlab CI, docker, SVN, Git, Buildbot, Ansible, Confliuence
