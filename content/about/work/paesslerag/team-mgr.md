Led an agile team responsible for mission-critical ERP systems turning over €4.5M per month. Also reduced delivery time of changes to the production systems. Introduced systematic approaches to deal with technical debt resulting in steadier levels thereof. Moved development from VMs to Docker shorting onboarding times from days to minutes and enabling much faster branch-building up to 400% in some cases. Changed IT Architecture to Tier-Based and narrowed strategic focus on enabling the business with the effect of higher team engagement and velocity.

Coached my team to become the best version of themselves with different feedback formats and 1:1 workshops to discover their self-confidence and clarity of thought.
Pioneered Innovation Management and developed multiple DevOps product ideas using Design Thinking and Design Sprints. Evangelized the company on numerous events as attendee and speaker at [DevOps Camp](https://twitter.com/DrSlow/status/1014203485108228096) and Webweek, making the company more visible to the community and potential candidates. Coled the introduction of companywide OKRs forming a tag-team and coordinating “war-rooms”.
