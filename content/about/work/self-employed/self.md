Among other smaller projects I built a [web-based image archive software](https://beautyfiles.net/archive/) for a internationally renowned photographer using BDD and Ruby on Rails. Worth emphasizing is a cascading category-based navigation, a lightbox-based cart, a live translation tool and a drag and drop image uploader. In addition to that I implement an administration interface to manage the entire application.

**Tools:** Ruby, Rails, Google Cloud, Javascript, Gherkin, Git, Capistrano
