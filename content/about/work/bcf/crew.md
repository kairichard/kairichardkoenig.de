As a bowman, trimmer, and first helm, on the Clipper Round The World Race, I was responsible for executing sail changes and fine-tuning sail trim to achieve optimal speed. Additionally, I steered the vessel to maximize Velocity Made Good (VMG), ensuring peak performance during races. My role required a deep understanding of sail dynamics, precise coordination, and quick decision-making to adapt to changing conditions and maintain competitive advantage.
