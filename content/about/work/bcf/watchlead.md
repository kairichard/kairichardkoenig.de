As a Watchlead on the Clipper Round The World Race, I was responsible for 6 to 7 sailors through our journey through some of the most remote and hostile places in the world. I made sure team members understood their roles and responsibilities and helping them to learn new skills. I also led evolutions and developed polar charts to determine optimal sail plans and target speeds, enhancing overall performance.
