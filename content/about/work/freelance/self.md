After my second endeavor (Bitspark) failed to solve a problem significant enough for customers to pay us, I started to explore different avenues of interest. Among which, I wrote two Pitch Decks, designed and build multiple products, created a business model simulation, and launched three websites.

And since I am never satisfied with what I know, I persued three more certifications during this time.
