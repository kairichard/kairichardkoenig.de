After my second endeavor (Bitspark) did not solve a problem significant enough for customers to pay us, I started to explore different avenues of interest. Among which, I wrote two Pitch Decks, designed and build multiple proof of concepts, created a business model simulation, ran a design thinking sprint, and launched three websites.  For more information head over to the [projects](https://kairichardkoenig.de/about/projects).

And since I am never satisfied with what I know, I persued three more certifications during this time.
