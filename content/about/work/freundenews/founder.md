Inspired by [friendfeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriendFeed) we took the concept and adapted it to the German market and eventually [sold to Mr.Wong](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/04/copy-paste-get-acquired-mister-wong-buys-freundenews/) The application was written in Ruby on Rail 2.0 with together with a background processing queue that pulled in the content from all the linked services.

**Tools:** Ruby, Rails, Git, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery
