At ICE, as one of the first Engineering Managers in a newly formed division under a new CTO, I was heavily involved in hiring additional Engineering Managers for other newly established teams. I played a pivotal role in introducing an agile and product-focused mindset to what I would describe as a legacy-oriented organization.

Focusing on my own teams, I built a group that developed a rock-solid Scala 3 application, replacing a highly customized legacy payment and invoicing off-the-shelf software. Instead of opting for a big bang approach, we devised and implemented a plan to replace components piece by piece, which allowed us to deliver value rapidly.

In the Data and Analytics team, I recruited members well-versed in modern data architectures like DBT and Data Lake, aiming to transform the team from a bottleneck into one offering a self-service platform. With both teams, I ensured they were not blocked, removed obstacles, and assisted them in navigating the organization. Apart from that, I conducted regular performance reviews and one-to-one meetings. To enhance overall knowledge on various topics, I facilitated hands-on and interactive workshops, which received excellent feedback.
