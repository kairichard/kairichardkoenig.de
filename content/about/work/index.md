## Paessler AG

##### Product Owner Business Intelligence 

March 2018 - April 2019 (1 year 2 months) - Nuremberg Area, Germany

Took over BI and changed the internal mission, introduced leaner processes and earlier feedback. Educated employees about ML with innovation projects and external Workshop. Reduced number of outages and fault in the reporting infrastructure. Introduced new KPIs to the business to gain company wide visibility into strategic actions, for instance the First- Response-Time for Customer-Services. Architected Prediction- and Enrichment-APIs to automatically score incoming leads and prioritize operational sales work to be more effective boosting conversion rates.

##### Team Manager Business Infrastructure Systems 

June 2016 - April 2019 (2 years 11 months) - Nuremberg Area, Germany

Managed a team responsible for mission-critical systems, reduced delivery time of changes to the production systems. Introduced systematic approaches to deal with technical debt resulting in steadier levels thereof. Moved development from VMs to Docker shorting onboarding times from days to minutes and enabling much faster branch-building. Changed IT Architecture to Tier-Based and narrowed strategic focus on enabling the business with the effect of higher team engagement. Pioneered Innovation Management and developed multiple DevOps product ideas using Design Thinking and Design Sprints. Evangelized the company on numerous events as attendee and speaker, making the company more visible to the community and potential candidates. Started to shift mindsets towards new working models and more strategic thinking, which eventually resulted into a transformative process in the entire company making goals more transparent and foster more collaboration.

##### Software Developer 

2013 - June 2016 (3 years 6 months) - Nuremberg Area, Germany

Led, designed and developed several critical software components for instance the asymmetric cryptographic activation mechanism of PRTG. I also developed tools to find abandoned shopping carts that resulted in recovering seemingly lost sales opportunities. Added goldilocks pricing strategy which alone led to ~3% more revenue. Maintained and optimized our infrastructure for these projects using Ansible, statsd and PRTG to deliver more throughput and consume less resources. Successfully introduced Scrum and carefully refined it to fit our needs. I also migrated a large repository from SVN to Git and Gitlab w/o service interruption, setting the ground work for the rest of the company to eventually switch from Mercurial to GIT and reap in huge benefits from Continuous Integration.

## Self-Employed

##### Software Engineer 

October 2010 - January 2013 (2 years 4 months) - Munich Area, Germany

Among other smaller project I built a web-based image archive software using BDD and Ruby on Rails. Worth emphasizing is a cascading category-based navigation, a lightbox- based cart, a live translation tool and a drag and drop image uploader. In addition to that I implement an administration interface to manage the entire app.

## HighText Verlag Graf und Treplin oHG

##### Software Developer 

March 2007 - October 2010 (3 years 8 months) - Munich Area, Germany

Rewrote a large portion of the web application at ibusiness.de so it would resemble a modern MVC app more closely. Then redid the Database- Abstraction-Layer, reimplemented all the affected controllers and wrote a new template parser. Designed and applied a way of organizing files inside the project by domains. This brought down development time and error rate significantly.
