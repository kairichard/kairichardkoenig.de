We were building a visual programming language with the runtime and user interface separate. I [conceptualized](https://twitter.com/Bitspark/status/1141976557852024833) and implemented a multi-tenant [microservice](https://twitter.com/Bitspark/status/1155728667978424320) architecture using Redis-streams, flask, AWS Lambda and [Vue with TS](https://twitter.com/Bitspark/status/1206914206613815297). Also introduced a CRM and various marketing integrations gaining more visibility into our potential customers. Created [goal framework](https://twitter.com/Bitspark/status/1110151359548932096) and [product roadmap](https://twitter.com/Bitspark/status/1140580614061662208). Wrote WebSocket server in Golang enabling more product features for our own product. Prepared and held demos, pitches, and presentations to potential customers, investors, and partners. However, due to running out of funds, we decided to part ways. During that time, I helped and coached one of my co-founders to make his next career move.

**Tools:** <span class="text-monospaced">Golang, Typescript, Vue.js, Python, Flask, Postgres, now.sh, Airtable, Zapier, Circle CI, Ansible, Lua, OpenResty, Redis, Terraform, Digital Ocean, Kubernetes, Cloudflare, Trello, Miro</span>
