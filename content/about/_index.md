Summary: Born and raised in Munich moved to Nuremberg and eventually Berlin. Before creating my first game with Shockwave in Lingo my interest was in 3D modelling and waiting for a render to finish in Maxon Cinema 4D. But with the experience of how powerful programming can be I started learning HTML then Javascript and moving to the backend side of things and onto PHP, memcached, MySQL and Ruby on Rails. And from there it never stopped.

#### Kai Richard König
I grew up in Munich, made my way to Nuremberg, and ultimately found a home in Berlin. My early fascination with digital creation started with 3D modeling and hours spent waiting for renders to finish in Maxon Cinema 4D. That curiosity evolved when I discovered the power of programming—first through crafting a game in Lingo with Shockwave and then learning HTML, JavaScript, and progressing to backend technologies like PHP, memcached, MySQL, and Ruby on Rails. That initial spark ignited a career where the pursuit of building and problem-solving never ceased.

Over the past 14 years, I’ve accumulated a diverse set of skills that bridge traditional and modern cloud application architectures, with a focus on building and leading agile teams committed to delivering high-value results efficiently and reliably. My strengths lie in envisioning transformative solutions and navigating less-trodden paths, which has consistently driven progress in established and emerging products. I excel at making strategic initiatives transparent through data-driven insights and fostering clear goals and communication through workshops and well-articulated discussions. Additionally, I enhance the speed and precision of value delivery by aligning technical capabilities with business objectives.

Throughout my career, Open Source has remained a cornerstone of my growth in programming. Contributing back whenever possible, I’ve fixed migration code in Django, refined Python buildpacks for Vercel (formerly ZEIT), and was recognized among the top 5% of GitHub contributors in Germany in 2019.

Beyond the office, I am an avid sailor with hands-on experience in competitive team environments. During my time with Team BCF, I combined strategic leadership with my passion for sailing, showcasing resilience and teamwork both on and off the water. When I’m not immersed in technology or sailing, you’ll find me playing badminton, exploring new cuisines, traveling, and delving into psychology, philosophy, investing, and entrepreneurship.
