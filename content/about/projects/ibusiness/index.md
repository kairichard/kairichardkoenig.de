Over the course of 10 months we rewrote a large portion of the web application at ibusiness.de so it would resemble a modern MVC app more closely. Together we redid the Database-Abstraction-Layer, reimplemented all the affected controllers and wrote a new template parser. Being done with that we designed an applied a more effective way of organizing files inside the project.
