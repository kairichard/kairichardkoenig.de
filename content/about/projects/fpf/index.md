I joined the futurpackaingforum as the first person with a deep product and technological expertise, the goal was to build a business around sustainable packaging. During my short stay I contributed a detailed business model using google sheets and monte carlo simulations and a significant portion of the pitch deck. I also conceptualized products variations that are easier to test and to build.
