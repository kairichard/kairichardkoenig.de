Logging in to different machines at work or at home and using the same .dotfiles on them. Bootstrap a new machine, even if they are differently flavored. Updating .dotfiles should be a breeze as well as sharing common .dotfiles with your teammates by just installing them next to your own .dotfiles. Lace drew inspiration from brew.
