Programming today requires a shift in thinking. This makes it hard to learn how to write programs. On top of that, IT experts often use a language which is difficult to understand for non technicians.
At [bitspark.de](https://bitspark.de) we develop [Slang](https://github.com/Bitspark/slang) which aims to make programming easier, faster and more comfortable. It avoids coding, repetition and frustration.
