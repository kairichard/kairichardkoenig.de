In the seminar phase of the BOS technology I enrolled for a Java project without any prior knowledge.
After a short introduction each participant could set his own project goal. I decided to visualize sorting algorithms.
The algorithms are implemented with the decorator pattern and thus are step-synchronized which provides a nice to look at visual feedback.
