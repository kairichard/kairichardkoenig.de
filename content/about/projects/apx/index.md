At [APX](https://apx.ac/) I mentor and share my experience with startups. This usually evolves around an all day mentoring event held every 3 Months. There I get to meet 3 - 4 different startups asking questions and picking brains of the mentors. Questions range from high level go to market strategy down to technical questions and or brain storming. It's up to the startups to make the most out of their time. Apart from that I infrequently visit the APX Offices doing "ask me anything" session with startups.
