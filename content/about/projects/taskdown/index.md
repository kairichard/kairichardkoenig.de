Taskdown is a task management solution designed to bridge the gap between Obsidian vaults and iOS devices. It provides a seamless way to manage and track tasks from your Obsidian vault directly on your iOS device, making it easier to stay organized and productive on the go.

The project aims to solve the challenge of accessing and managing Obsidian tasks while away from your computer, offering a mobile-friendly interface that maintains the power and flexibility of Obsidian's task management system.
