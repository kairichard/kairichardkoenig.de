Some time ago, I tweeted about a service I have built.

{{< tweet 1168542359518359552 >}}


A system that can alert you via email if a stock crosses a threshold either up or down. That is it, nothing more. It's a combination of iexcloud, python code, docker, ansible, airtable, and mailgun - all tied together in an afternoon.


There were multiple reasons why I felt the need to do that. First, I wanted to know when BYND fell below $145 because I saw an opportunity for my portfolio there. But guess what, I was unable to find an app that would let me enter a stock symbol, a number, and email. Maybe I don't have enough google foo, or the foo is starting to leave me. Anyhow. The second element of my motivation was that I realized I hadn't produced anything meaningful and visible in months since quitting my job and joining an early-stage tech company. Yup that company, I mean we, haven't shipped yet and it drags me down sometimes. So I vented with that little creation. 


I was totally astounded by the number of users who started using that little tool. I got exactly one user, which was me. Was I aiming for more? Maybe, maybe some validation beyond just me patting my self on the back seeing that I am still able to swing things together and make something work front to back. By the way, I since shut that thing down. Mainly because, well, I now use Think Or Swim, which does price alerts and a lot more. 


But what is important are the following things, no one cares what I build and that is a good thing because the world is not about me it's about the people around me. I should have built something for them, help them with your skills and abilities. Another valuable lesson was that my reach is almost equal to zero. 


I say 'almost' because I was lucky, lucky that someone reshared what I did for the technology and maybe the lean-ishness of how I did it. And that got picked up by @timothep who runs a podcast on developer stories and asked if I wanted to take part in his series. To which I said yes. And I hope that the stories we talk about might inspire others or at least make them laugh a little.


The point I am trying to make is that you should never stop creating. I even when you think you never reach anybody or only want to prove something to your self, do it, create it and things will change. I often picture the causality of actions like a thermodynamic system that is in it's lowest energy state, where all systems want to be, and only by putting energy into it, it starts to change - the same with creating. If you want change you need to create (it).
